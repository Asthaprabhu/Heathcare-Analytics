Introduction:

  Healthcare organizations are under increasing pressure to improve patient care outcomes and achieve better care. While this situation represents a challenge, it also offers organizations an opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of care by leveraging more value and insights from their data. Health care analytics refers to the analysis of data using quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore trends and patterns in the acquired data. While healthcare management uses various metrics for performance, a patientâ€™s length of stay is an important one.

  Being able to predict the length of stay (LOS) allows hospitals to optimize their treatment plans to reduce LOS, to reduce infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors.
